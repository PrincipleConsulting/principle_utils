description: "Principle Utils is a versatile Dart utility package designed to accelerate Flutter development with essential tools for responsive layouts, string manipulation, and consistent theming. It provides:
Adaptive Responsiveness: Scale layouts using iPhone 16 Pro (402x874px) as a base, with utilities for screen dimensions, orientation detection, and physical size calculations (e.g., centimeters).
String Conversions: Transform text across 14+ formats (camelCase, snake_case, SpOnGeCaSe, etc.) via chainable extensions.
Color Utilities: Convert HEX â†” Color with validation, and access Material-style predefined palettes (blue500, gray800).
Type Safety: Manage data states (DataSuccess, DataError), implement clean architecture with UseCase, and use tuples/key-value pairs.
Sizing System: Predefined spacing (TWSpace.sp16), font sizes, and elevation constants for pixel-perfect UIs.
Ideal for teams prioritizing cross-device consistency, Principle Utils simplifies complex tasks with intuitive extensions, reduces boilerplate, and enforces brand alignment. Enhance productivity while maintaining clean, scalable code."
